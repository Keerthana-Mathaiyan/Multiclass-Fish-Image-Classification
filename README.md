🐠 Deep Learning Beneath the Waves: Multiclass Fish Image Classification 🌊

Excited to share my latest computer vision project — a Multiclass Fish Image Classification System built to automatically identify different fish species from images using deep learning! 🎯

The project involved:
🔹 Building and balancing a dataset of 11 fish species (shrimp, bream, trout, sea bass, and more)
🔹 Implementing multiple pretrained CNN architectures — VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNet, InceptionV3, and EfficientNetB0
🔹 Comparing model performance on accuracy and loss across train, validation, and test datasets
🔹 Visualizing dataset distributions and model metrics for deeper insights

💡 Key Insights:

MobileNet and InceptionV3 achieved outstanding accuracy (~95–98%), outperforming heavier models like ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0.

Dataset splits were carefully stratified, ensuring balanced representation across all species.

The results highlight how lightweight architectures can excel when tuned effectively — even in complex, multi-class marine datasets.

🌍 This project combines marine biology and AI, showing how computer vision can support sustainable fishing, species monitoring, and marine research.
